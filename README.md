<!--html-->
  **<p id = "comments">COMMENTS</p>   <!-- p ID= "comments", line 92---JAVASCRIPT SHOULD FORCE THIS TEXT TO STAY THE SAME FORNT, BUT ALWAYS DISPLAY IN CAPS-->










<!-- something i am thinking of :

    should we create JS so that the task one full div class is repeated 
    over and over when the submit button is pushed? so basically rhe same
    css wil go through, but the action wil be repeated? 

    Also, it should be noted that 
        TASK
        COMMENTS
        TIME DUE
        DATE DUE
    should be where the user puts the information in. that should show the 
    user input
