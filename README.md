# GroupProject1
first group project






















































  <!--ACE       I think it would look best if header were moved to to top of the page, moving the left side task bar to underneath, in line with to complete and completed, to make the app look more clean--> 








<!--ACE     Time Due should be in a timestamp format, only legit hours can be input, check bootstrap forms for this>

<!--ACE     Folder should be changed into a dropdown style menu so that users cannot be confused. later down the road, users may be able to add a new folder to add things to (example: a "kids" folder)>
<!--ACE     javascript: border of same color goes around tasks when to complete is on and when completed is on. border color switches-->
















<!--ACE     js number the checkboxes-->   




<!--ACE     html-->
  **<p id = "comments">COMMENTS</p>   <!-- p ID= "comments", line 92---JAVASCRIPT SHOULD FORCE THIS TEXT TO STAY THE SAME FORNT, BUT ALWAYS DISPLAY IN CAPS-->










<!--ACE      something i am thinking of : should we create JS so that the task one full div class is repeated over and over when the submit button is pushed? so basically rhe same css wil go through, but the action wil be repeated? Also, it should be noted that :**TASK,COMMENTS,TIME DUE, DATE DUE** should be where the user puts the information in. that should show the user input-->
